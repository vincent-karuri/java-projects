# A simple webapp built using Spring and deployed to Tomcat

This project implements a simple web app that can be deployed to tomcat.

It follows along this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@yuntianhe/create-a-web-project-with-maven-spring-mvc-b859503f74d7).

It also includes configuration files that can be used when deploying the web app on port 80 of a remote or local tomcat server instance.

The project also contains Packer and Ansible scripts that can be used to build an AWS AMI with Tomcat installed and configured.
